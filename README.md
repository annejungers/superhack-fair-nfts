# PROBLEM
Royalties on secondary sales are a new way that creators can benefit from their work. Typically the value of a creator's work accrues over time, and in the past, the creator has got little benefit. This benefit went to intermediators instead. This is something that the blockchain tries to eliminate.

The blockchain allows royalties to be encoded in a smart contract. This has become a common feature of NFTs. However, it cannot be enforced in smart contracts and is up to the marketplace whether to observe the creators wishes.  Many marketplaces enforce royalties, but plenty do not. Over-the-counter trades, also prove a problem.

Those marketplaces that do enforce royalties use various strategies that are designed to capture buyers and creators at the cost of interoperability and fair competition. Standardisation is a solution, but will only come with social and market pressue.

Many members of the crypto community also argue that enforcement is also against the ethos of the movement. Our position is that there can be a choice: a creator can chose not to ask for a royalty, however the choice to ignore the wishes of a creator should come with other costs. 

# APPROACH
This project will use various techniques to surface and highlight to buyers and creators the way in which NFTs have been traded, and the degree to which royalies have been paid. This in turn 
This will tend create a bifurcation in the buyer market between those that care about profit more than the creation itself. Some creations will naturally fall into the 'flipper' category and traded for nothing other than expectation of profit. Others will appeal to holders who keep them more for their artistic merit, collectability or some accrued benefit. 

It is expected that this will improve the desirability of those with a clean royalty record. This will likely flow through to price, counterbalancing the royalty in some way.
The solution will therefore incentivise payment of royalties by:
    • Creating a sigma around unpaid royalties and a social norm that they should be paid, 
      so that there is a value differential in price that counterbalances the royalty cost.
    • Exposing the royalty payment status at point of sale
    • Highlighting cases where the royalty has not been paid
    • Exposing suspiciously low prices (over the counter side-payments)
    • Exposing attempts to avoid payment using various techniques such as wrapping
    • Allowing users to transfer between wallets without being market as a
